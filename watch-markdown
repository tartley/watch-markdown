# Usage: watch-markdown <Markdown-file>
#
# Convert <markdown-file> to an HTML file. Open the HTML in Falkon, which has
# the nice property that if the HTML is subsequently modified, it auto-updates.
# Watch for modifications to the Markdown file. If any occur, regenerate the
# HTML file.

# TODO: What happens if I skip my explicit error checks on the given markdown
# file, and just pass it to pandoc? Does it produce equivalent (or better?)
# error messages for me?
#
# TODO: reinstate my customizations to github.css.
#
# TODO: Do we even need the watch-markdown-gui wrapper? Adding it did not fix
# the leftover processes problem (a correct 'trap' cleanup fixed that.)
#
# TODO: Check it also works by 'Open With Other Application'
#
# TODO: Consider breaking out the conversion into a new wrapper script,
# `markdown2html`, so that I can invoke that standalone and be sure of getting
# the same output as I see when using this tool. Can we handle markdown on
# stdin as an alternative to a named file parameter?
#
# TODO: With markdown2html in place for when we explicitly want to generate an
# html file, watch-markdown could write its html to /tmp, and delete it when
# done, so as not to clutter things with unwanted html files every time we view
# markdown.
#
# TODO: Same thing but for rst. Which presumably pandoc handles too.
#
# TODO: Turn off set -x
